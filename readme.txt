== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What fees are associated with the gateway? =
Checkout.com uses Interchange++ which offers more transparency than other pricing models. With Checkout.com there are no minimums, no contracts required and pricing is based on your transaction volume and history.

Other payment processors charge a blended rate. We use the Interchange++ model, a payment processing fee structure that standardizes the commissions collected by card issuers such as Visa and Mastercard. The amount varies based on card type, the customer's issuing bank, merchant location, and other parameters.

Using Interchange++, we pass the fees charged by card brands directly through to you. Checkout.com charges a single, consistent mark-up that never changes, so you’ll have full transparency of your costs and know exactly what you’re paying. There are also no hidden fees, no setup fees and no account maintenance fees. Additionally, you’ll also get:

* Dedicated account management and service
* Risk and fraud management tools
* Integration with all major shopping carts
